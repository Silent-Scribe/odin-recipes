        </ul>
    <h3>For the stew:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>20ml sunflower oil</li>
            <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>10g fresh ginger, finely grated</li>
            <li>480g tomato puree</li>
            <li>500ml chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 handful curry leaves</li>
            <li>salt, to taste</li>
            <li>sugar, to taste</li>
            <li>45g butter</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the chicken in a glass or plastic bowl and add the lemon or lime juice. Cover and set aside until you’ve prepared your spice and nut mixture.</li>
            <li>Heat a dry, clean pan over medium heat and add the cloves, peppercorns, piece of cinnamon stick, bay leaves, coriander, cumin, cardamom seeds, chillies, turmeric and almonds.</li>
            <li>Gently roast the spices and nuts for a few minutes or until lightly toasted and aromatic, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Allow to cool slightly then tip the contents into a coffee grinder and grind into a powder before stirring it into the yoghurt.</li>
            <li>If you do not have a coffee grinder, place the mixture into your processor and add the yoghurt and coconut cream, then blitz.</li>
            <li>Now add the spiced yoghurt mixture to the chicken, stir well, cover and set aside to marinate for 2 hours in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>After 2 hours. heat the sunflower oil in a large pan and add the onions. Sauté until golden then add the garlic and ginger.</li>
            <li>Cook lightly for a few seconds then add the tomato puree, bring to boil, then add the chicken stock and curry leaves, I like to chop them up, your call.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil and reduce heat. Simmer uncovered until the sauce has reduced considerably and thickened to your liking. This can take anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes</li>
            <li>Now add the chicken and the yoghurt-spice mixture to the simmering sauce and stir.</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a boil and cook for a few minutes until the chicken is just cooked right through: any longer will make the chicken tough and stringy.</li>
            <li>Finally, add the butter and stir through. At this point do not boil again as the butter will separate from the rest of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Garnish with coriander leaves and serve with basmati rice, sambals and naan breads.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Cook's note:</strong>If you dislike the extreme tart taste of the tomato and yoghurt combo, add sugar to taste. If the dish is not salty enough to your liking, add salt.</p>
